This project tries to recreate a basic calculator using Java (JDK --> 17), OOP principles and the functional programming paradigm using streams and the reduce method.

This calculator allows a user to add as many numbers as he wants, make addition, subtraction, division, multiplication and find the remainder between numbers. 

To run the program just go to the main class and press the run button.
